        5. Lawful grounds for processing your personal information
      </Heading>
      <Text>
        <p>
          Generally, the processing of your personal information as described in
          this policy is permitted by one or more lawful grounds, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Where we have your consent for example, we only use your information
            to send you marketing communications with your consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where the processing is reasonably necessary for the performance of
            a contract to which you are a party as an individual, for example,
            we may rely on this basis when we enter into a contract with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where the processing is reasonably necessary for the purpose of a
            legitimate interest pursued by us and only when the processing does
            not override your privacy rights. Our “legitimate interests” include
            promote well-being, reduce isolation, build friendships, raise
            self-esteem, and encourage regular group activities, which is very
            rewarding for our members of staff and partners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where the processing is necessary for archiving, research or
            statistical purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where we process special category data, we will ensure we only do so
            in accordance with one of the additional lawful grounds for
            processing that type of data, for example where we have your
            explicit consent.

          </li>
          <li>
            Correct personal information about you which you think is
            inaccurate.
          </li>

            commonly used format.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not use automated decision-making processes to make decisions about
            you. In some circumstances, we use third-party organisations to
            either store personal information or use them to help deliver our
            services to you, for example, a third-party database provider. Where
            we have these arrangements, we always put an agreement in place
            requiring the third-party to protect personal information and comply
            with their obligations under data protection law.

          Shapeshifter Productions may from time to time use third-party

          Economic Area (EEA). In these cases, we will always ensure your
          personal information is safeguarded by ensuring your information is
          processed only in countries that provide an adequate level of
          protection or where appropriate safeguards, such as model contract
          clauses or binding corporate rules are in place with the third-party

        <p>
          Personal information will be retained for the duration of the project
          period relevant to you or your organisation. We will evaluate this
          data periodically to determine whether we should continue to hold such

          reasonably necessary for the purposes for which we hold it, taking
          into account relevant legal and regulatory retention requirements
          (e.g. Tax regulations require appropriate financial records to be
          retained for six years). We will usually securely delete your personal
          information six years after our last contact with you. For further
